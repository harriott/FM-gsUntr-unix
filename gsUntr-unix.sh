# Prepare Untracked files for committing to a unix-only Git repository.

# The default action is to go ahead and convert the selected files to unix,
# but this script optionally takes a single argument:
#   If the argument is given, don't go ahead with the conversion,
#     but instead open vim on the selected files for further inspection,
#   except where the argument is 'd', in which case go ahead with a conversion to dos.
# If no argument and not in a Git repository ask what to do.
